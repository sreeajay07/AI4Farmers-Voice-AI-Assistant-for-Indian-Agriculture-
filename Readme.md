## Introduction

**AI4Farmers** is an innovative voice-enabled AI assistant designed to empower Indian farmers with timely and accurate agricultural information in their local languages. This project aims to bridge the critical information gap often faced by rural communities, facilitating better decision-making and sustainable farming practices.

Farmers can simply speak their queries in their preferred language, and the AI assistant provides concise, actionable advice on various farming topics. By making vital agricultural knowledge accessible through natural voice interaction, AI4Farmers strives to enhance productivity and improve the livelihoods of farmers across India.
